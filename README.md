# React + TypeScript + Vite

This is my submission for the Frontend Technical Assesment for the role of Full Stack Software Engineer at Beep.

I have used react + typescript + vite for this project.
Tailwind CSS is used for styling.
Floating UI is used for the modal.

## Setup
npm install
npm run dev

The app should be running on http://localhost:5173/
This repository also has been deployed on https://main--beep-frontend-assessment.netlify.app
```
